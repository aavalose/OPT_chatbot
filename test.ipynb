       "'Here\\'s a comprehensive answer to the question \"What is Optional Practical Training (OPT)?\"\\n\\n**1. Direct Answer:**\\n\\nOptional Practical Training (OPT) is a work authorization available to F-1 international students, allowing them to gain practical work experience directly related to their major field of study. Students are eligible for a total of up to 12 months of OPT per higher education level.\\n\\n**2. Relevant Requirements & Eligibility:**\\n\\n*   **Eligibility Requirements:**\\n    *   Must have been enrolled full-time in F-1 student status for at least one academic year (two consecutive terms).\\n    *   Must not have exceeded 364 days of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT) in their current program.\\n    *   A job offer is not required to apply for OPT.\\n*   **Types of OPT:**\\n    *   **Pre-Completion OPT:** Used before program completion.\\n    *   **Post-Completion OPT:** Used after program completion.\\n    *   **STEM OPT Extension:** An additional 24 months for students with qualifying STEM degrees, *after* completing a period of Post-Completion OPT.\\n\\n**3. Important Considerations & Warnings:**\\n\\n*   **OPT is field-specific:** The work experience must be directly related to your major field of study.\\n*   **Pre-Completion OPT Time Deduction:** If you use part-time Pre-Completion OPT, the time is deducted at half the rate from your total 12 months of OPT eligibility. For example, 5 months of part-time Pre-Completion OPT will deduct 2.5 months from your total OPT time.\\n*   **Reapplication for Remaining OPT Time:** If you use Pre-Completion OPT, you must reapply and pay the filing fee again to use any remaining time for either Pre-Completion or Post-Completion OPT.\\n*   **Post-Completion OPT Unemployment Limit:** During Post-Completion OPT, you are limited to an aggregate maximum of 90 days of unemployment.\\n*   **STEM OPT Employer Requirements**: To be eligible for the STEM OPT extension, your employer *must* be enrolled in the E-Verify system, and the position *must* be paid and full-time (over 20 hours per week).\\n\\n**4. Next Steps & Recommended Actions:**\\n\\n*   **Explore OPT Resources:** Review the information available on the ISSS website: [https://myusf.usfca.edu/isss/students/f-1/employment/optinfo](https://myusf.usfca.edu/isss/students/f-1/employment/optinfo)\\n*   **Watch the OPT Information Video:** [https://usfca.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c4243f9f-5f77-4e97-bb59-b26f006cbc36&start=0.696347](https://usfca.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c4243f9f-5f77-4e97-bb59-b26f006cbc36&start=0.696347)\\n*   **Attend OPT Workshops/Advising:** Take advantage of the bi-weekly OPT drop-in advising hours offered by ISSS.
