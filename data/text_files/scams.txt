What to look out for with Employment Scams?

Beware of employment scams and fraudulent employers!

There are people who target international students by pretending to offer them a job to obtain money or sensitive information.

Examples of fraudulent employers and employment scams: 

Employers who require a “training fee” in exchange for a job offer 
Employers who ask you to use your personal funds to purchase gift cards, cryptocurrency, or ask you to wire money
What are the effects of working with a fraudulent employer?

Students who have been willingly or unwillingly employed by fraudulent employers could be considered engaging in fraud, which could impact re-entry into the US and application for immigration benefits in the future. If you believe you have been a victim of an employment scam, or have been employed by a fraudulent employer, contact your ISSS advisor. We may recommend that you speak with an immigration attorney.

It is always best to ask questions and do research on a potential employer if you have any doubts. Being aware of these scams, asking questions, and doing additional research can help minimize your chances of falling victim to fraudulent employers and employment scams.
