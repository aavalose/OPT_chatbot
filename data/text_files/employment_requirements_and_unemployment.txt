What work can students engage in during OPT?

Students can only engage in employment related to their major field of study on OPT. 

To be considered “employed”, a student needs to be working full-time i.e., over 20 hours/week in a major field of study.  This employment can be paid, unpaid, an internship, volunteer work, or self-employment. There is no maximum number of jobs or work hours restricted on OPT.

All OPT employment has to be related to your major field of study

OPT employment cannot be related to your minor. Students should make sure that they are able to show that all their jobs are directly related to their major field of study. Students can do this by showing a direct connection of their job duties to their course curriculum. If students are not sure if a job is in their major field of study, they should ask their academic department for their opinion. While opinions of faculty, departments, and professionals in the field are helpful, ultimately it is up to the student to demonstrate this connection.

A U.S. Employer Address needs to be reported

Students working on OPT can work in-person, in a hybrid format or remotely from within the US. Whether the student is working in-person or remotely, the employer address needs to be within the US.

Students on OPT can work anywhere in the United States, with multiple employers at one time, and can change employers as many times as they wish as long as their employment is related to their major field of study. It is not possible to work fully remotely from outside of the US during OPT. Students are required to report a US address as the site of employment for these types of work authorization. Temporary travel abroad is allowed, but a physical US address is still required as the primary site of employment.

What is considered employment?

Students on OPT are expected to be employed during their approved OPT period. As previously discussed, to be considered “employed”, a student needs to be working over 20 hours/week in a position that is related to their major field of study. 

Is there a limit on the number of days I can be unemployed?

Unemployment limits while on OPT are different for students on pre-completion and post-completion OPT.

Pre-completion OPT: there is no limit on unemployment. You may be approved for pre-completion and not engage in any employment, and it won’t impact your F-1 status.
Post-completion OPT: the unemployment limit is a total of 90 days. If you exceed 90 days of unemployment during post-completion OPT, you are considered in violation of your F-1 status.
When do I start accruing unemployment days?

You will start accruing unemployment days on your approved OPT start date if you do not report qualifying employment on the SEVP portal. Your approved OPT start date is listed on your EAD card. Students who do not receive their EAD card after their OPT start date could also accrue unemployment days.

IMPORTANT: SEVP can terminate your SEVIS record if you have not reported an employer or have exceeded the maximum days of unemployment while on post-completion OPT.

- Violations of OPT and F-1 Student Status
What happens if you exceed the unemployment limit?

Students who exceed 90 days of unemployment will be considered in violation of their OPT and F-1 status. It is your responsibility to report your employment on the SEVP portal, keep track of your unemployment days and ensure that you are not exceeding 90 days of unemployment. 

What are your options before you exceed the unemployment limit and violate your visa status?

You can take the following actions before exceeding 90 days of unemployment to ensure that you are not in violation of your F-1 status:

Gain acceptance to another school and transfer (https://myusf.usfca.edu/isss/students/f-1/transfer your SEVIS record
