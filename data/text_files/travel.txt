- Can students travel during OPT?

It is possible to travel while applying for or on OPT, but students should have all the information and documents* they need before departing the U.S. It can be much harder to prepare for reentry from outside of the U.S. and while traveling. 

*Please note your passport should always be valid for 6 months into the future

Should students travel while their OPT application is pending?

Until you complete your program of study, you will continue to travel as an enrolled student. Once you have graduated, the documents that you need will vary depending on the status of your OPT application. Travel before your OPT is approved can be complicated. 

If your OPT application was pending when you left the U.S. but is approved before you have returned, you will need to have your EAD card with you to reenter the U.S. on approved OPT. This may require international mailing adding additional risk and complications.

Please refer to the chart below to determine which documents you will need: 'images/docs_needed_for_travel.png'

What to consider before international travel after graduation

After students complete their program (the date of your last class or completion of your last assignment or exam), you have 60 days to consider your options for staying in the U.S. also known as your 60 Day Grace Period. If you would like to stay in the U.S. be sure to consider your options before departing the U.S.

During these 60 days you can travel within the U.S., but you cannot re-enter in F-1 status if you leave the U.S. without applying for OPT. Students can re-enter in F-1 status with a pending OPT application. Students applying for OPT after their Program Completion and on their 60 Day Grace Period should submit their OPT application to USCIS before departing the U.S. Please visit the Completing Program section of our Current F1 Student Services webpage (https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1626497/pages/required-documents-for-travel?module_item_id=18493815#:~:text=Current%20F1%20Student,an%20external%20site)

Travel before your OPT is approved can be complicated. Attend an OPT Drop-In Advising Session to discuss further.

- Traveling Abroad for an Extended Period of Time

Can students work abroad while on OPT?

Students on OPT or STEM OPT should remain primarily in the U.S. for their employment. There is not a clearly defined amount of time that you can be abroad, but here are some considerations when making travel arrangements:

Remaining outside of the U.S. for more than 5 months can result in the loss of your F-1 status.
Students on OPT and STEM OPT can be seen as gaining days of unemployment if they are outside of the U.S. for extended periods of time.
Students on OPT and STEM OPT taking trips abroad for more than 1 month should consult their ISSS advisor.
