- What is the OPT application process?

The process of applying for Optional Practical Training (OPT) employment authorization is very detailed. It is important to pay close attention to this course and follow the steps outlined accurately:

1. Complete the OPT course via Canvas within 1 year of when you will apply for OPT. We recommend completing the course when you are getting ready to prepare and submit the application to USCIS so that you can remember all the important details.

2. Prepare your application materials in a digital format.

3. Submit the OPT I-20 request through MyISSS (https://usfca.instructure.com/courses/1626497/pages/overview?module_item_id=18493803#:~:text=MyISSS,an%20external%20site.). to be issued a new I-20 Form with an OPT recommendation.

4. Retrieve your OPT I-20 Form, print, physically sign, and date it in black ink. Scan your physically signed OPT I-20 Form and add it to your digital OPT application materials.

5. Create a USCIS (https://myaccount.uscis.gov/sign-in) and complete your OPT application (Form I-765) online. Reference this PDF (https://myusf.usfca.edu/sites/default/files/users/sruszkowski/OPT_OnlineFiling.pdf) for assistance completing your application online.

Do you need to apply for a Social Security Number (SSN) with your application?

The SSN is an unique identification number that your employer will require of you for wage and tax purposes. You will receive a SSN card from the Social Security Administration (SSA) if you had requested a SSN within your I-765 OPT application. The SSN card is sent separately from your EAD card and typically arrives 7 business days after you receive the EAD card from USCIS. If you already have a SSN, you do not need to apply for it again with your I-765 OPT application.
